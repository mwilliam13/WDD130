    <h2>Joy, Creativity, Love</h2>
    <p>Sourdough baking is a source of joy and creativity. As a descendant of bakers from both sides of my parents’ families, I feel connected to my ancestors each time I bake. Each loaf is unique, shaped by the environment, the flour, and the baker's hand. The process is filled with ups and downs—loaves that rise beautifully and others that don't, crusts that snap and pop as they cool, and flavors that deepen and develop through the Maillard reaction. These variations are not setbacks but opportunities to learn and grow. The act of baking becomes a mindful practice, a moment to slow down and connect with the food we eat.</p>

    <p>Some of my favorite tools are a rigid PP plastic bench scraper, bread lame, banneton basket, digital scale, and bread towels. I keep my starter in a cleaned 5 lb Skippy peanut butter jar. The lid center cut out and a coffee filter to allow it to breathe.</p>
