    <h2>Starter</h2>
    <p>There are health benefits to eating home-baked sourdough. The leavening agent in sourdough is a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast), like what's found in yogurt. These beneficial microbes play a crucial role in gut health, aiding digestion and potentially boosting the immune system. Sourdough fermentation also breaks down gluten and antinutrients, making the bread easier to digest and the nutrients more accessible.</p>

    <p>My starter isn't just any starter; imagine nurturing a lineage of yeast and bacteria that traces back over 200 years, with accounts over the Oregon Trail in 1847. I received my starter from my friend, Adam, who received his from <a href="https://carlsfriends.net/" target="_)blank">Carlâ€™s Friends</a>. This continuity connects us to our ancestors and highlights the resilience and dependability of these microbial cultures. Each batch of sourdough bread is a testament to centuries of adaptation and survival.</p>
