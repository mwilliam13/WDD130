        <h2>(Bill)</h2></p>
    
    <p>I am in the Applied Technology program persuing my BS. I've worked in IT as a Systems Engineer at a major hospital in my city. I've worked there since May of 2000. I am married and we have two sweet little boys.</p>
    <p>One of the things I like most about BYU Idaho is the integrated spiritual method of learning. No where else can someone learn true and everlasting principles of the Gospel as disciples of Christ while also learning to code html, in pursit of a degree.</p>
    <p>My focus with this class is for a certificate in programming. Though it is not pertinent to my career, to me, web design is a very interesting topic. As I develop and focus my talents in places I would like to improve, the new skills I learn can open doors for the future.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Church. I have served in many wonderful capacities and have enjoyed every calling I have ever been asked to serve in.</p>
    <p>Currently, I have been studying an October 2006 talk by Elder Bednar called <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them?lang=eng" target="_blank">And Nothing Shall Offend Them</a>. It is especially poigniant to me at this time as our ward is needing an innoculation against the world, and reactiviation is key for our unit. Elder Bednar speaks about us as "agents." We have the choice to act, "and we primarily are to act and not just be acted upon. To believe that someone or something can make us feel offended, angry, hurt, or bitter diminishes our moral agency and transforms us into objects to be acted upon," citing <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=13-14#p13" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:13-14</a>.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to be in this class with you. Each of you are meant to be here together for a reason and I hope we can learn to love and accept and be of service one to another.</p>
