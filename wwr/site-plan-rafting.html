    <p>The purpose of the Dry Oar website is to inform and communicate the service offerings we have for our clients. It will expand on the services, schedules, availability, expectations, saftey, and other pertinent information we feel is most valuable and requested for clients both new and returning. As a public portal into our business, the content will help drive interest into our vertical and our company, which will increase revenue. As we prepare and diseminate information, both expectations and educational, it will keep our clients informed on saftey and understanding of how we operate. After experiences with our clients, we can post images and testimonials of the fun, excitement, and team-building opportunities they have had, thus improving interest and revenues.</p>
